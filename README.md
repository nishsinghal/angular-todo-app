# To do list app using Angular.JS

I recently started learning Angular and built this app to practise using Angular directives. This has been built using Angular, HAML and SCSS.

## How to run it

    cd angular-todo-app

Make sure you have middleman installed

    $ gem install middleman
  
Start the middleman server

    middleman server

    open http://localhost:4567
